**Recommendation system**

##  Project Objective
This project aims to develop a **simplified social network** integrating a **recommendation system**.

The system provides:
- Friend recommendations based on social network structure
- Post recommendations based on user interactions (likes)

The project focuses on the **design and implementation of recommendation algorithms in Python**.


##  Implemented Recommendation Systems

###  Friend Recommendation
- Based on **social graph similarity**
- Uses the **Jaccard coefficient**
- Recommends users with common friends

###  Post Recommendation
- Based on **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**
- Uses **Cosine Similarity**
- Recommends posts liked by similar users

📈 Expected Results

- Display of the global social network graph
- Highlighted friend recommendations in a different color
- List of recommended posts with relevance scores

🚀 Future Improvements

- Web interface integration.
- Content-based recommendation
- Time-aware interaction weighting
- Export recommendations via an API
